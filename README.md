# eForms SDK Documentation

Please use the [**TED Developer Docs**](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/) portal if you want to read the eForms SDK Documentation.

This Github repository is only used for authoring the SDK documentation and maintaining its different versions.\
The eForms SDK Documentation is written in AsciiDoc, following the docs-as-code paradigm. 

## How this repository is organised
The main branch of this repository is not used. It contains only this README.md file and serves the purpose 
of informing you about our approach for creating and publishing the eForms SDK documentation.

For each version of the eForms SDK, a separate branch is maintained in this repository containing the sources
of the documentation for the respective version of SDK. 
This allows us to retrospectively fix errors in previous versions of the SDK documentation (fixing broken links for example).  

Branch names indicate only the major and minor version number of the eForms SDK to the documentation of which their content corresponds.
The documentation of the latest revision of each minor version of the SDK is always available to you in the  [**TED Developer Docs**](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/) portal.
