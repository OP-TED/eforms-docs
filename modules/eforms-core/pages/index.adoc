NOTE: The documentation of the eForms Core Library is **not yet ready** for publication. We are working on it and we will update this page as soon as we have something we can share.

The eForms Core Library provides a set of classes that can be used when implementing some features typical (common) to eForms Applications:

* Automatically discovering and downloading new versions of the eForms SDK.
* Maintaining and instantiating at runtime the correct application component versions for different major versions of the SDK.
