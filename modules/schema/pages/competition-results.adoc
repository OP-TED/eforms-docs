= Direct Award Pre-announcement, Competition Results, Contract Completion

Direct Award Pre-announcement is a voluntary form (Voluntary Ex-Ante 
Transparency Notice) that allows an early announcement of the intent to 
sign a directly awarded contract. (NB: for the transportation directives, 
T01/T02 are to be used instead).
Contract Completion Notice is a voluntary form that allows, once the 
procurement procedure is over, to report actual aggregated amounts 
(i.e. payments, penalties) and review requests statuses.
These two previous forms have a lot in common with the Result one.

Competition results are shared using Result notices. Such notices have a
single "_efac:NoticeResult_" element containing information about the
latest award decisions and potentially about the lots still to be
awarded.

== Notice Result

The Notice Result section of a Result notice contains various
information (cf. <<noticeResultStructureFigure>>):

* The result for a lot for which the decision was recently made
or is still pending,

* The tenders received for the lots about which a decision has
been made and is shared with the notice,

* The contracts that have been signed following the award of
lots,

* The parties that submitted tenders for the lots of the notice
whose awarding decision has been made and is shared in the notice.

* The aggregated amounts covering all awarded lots of the
notice.

This section should be interpreted slightly differently for the DAP and 
Contract Completion notices although they share the same structure.

For the DAP:
* This section is about the intention to award a contract without a formal 
competition (with some justification),
* There are no statistics about concurrently received tenders,
* The contract is about to get signed in a near future,

For the contract completion:
* This section contains details about terminated (completed or not) contracts,
* Information is provided on a per lot (lotresult ???) bases,
* It additionally provide details on the requested reviews

All these topics will be further detailed in the following sections with 
occasionally some additional information when ambiguity may exist between 
the various form types.

[[noticeResultStructureFigure]]
.Overall structure of the Notice Result section
image::image013.jpg[image,width=455,height=298]


It should also be considered that this structure differs from the one
defined by the Standard and to comply with it,
cac:TenderResult/cbc:AwardDate must be present in the XML instance. It
is sufficient to have only one such occurrence and the associated
value shall be "2000-01-01Z".

== Notice aggregated amounts

Notice Value is about the aggregated value of all awarded lots of the
notice.

Notice Framework Value is about the aggregated Maximum Framework
Value, estimated or actual, for all awarded lots of the noticefootnote:[When a group of lots with a Framework is awarded, the computation should be based on the Framework associated value instead of the ones of the individual lots it is composed of.].

For any group of lots of the notice having a group framework agreement,
the reference to the Group of lots as well as the Group Framework Value 
(Maximum and/or Reestimated) shall be specified. Group Framework Values and 
the associated reference to the lot may be "unpublished"; when done so, 
the dates of publication for all unpublished elements shall be the same.

All these amounts have to be expressed using codes of the
https://op.europa.eu/web/eu-vocabularies/dataset/-/resource?uri=http://publications.europa.eu/resource/dataset/currency[Currency]
codelist to designate the currency as "_currencyID_" attribute and decimal
numbers.

Further details on the fields may be found in the following table and an
overview of the structure as well as a mark-up excerpt are provided
later on.

== Lot Result

A Notice Result shall contain at least one LotResult with a made
decisionfootnote:[i.e. for which "_cbc:TenderResultCode_" is either "close-nw" or "selec-w".].

This does not apply to a DAP notice for which LotResult is optional and award implicit.

LotResult applies exclusively to a single lot. This element contains
various information (cf. table below and against figure):

* Statistics on received submissions (highest & lowest value
tenders, received quantity per submission type),

* Procurement procedure outcome, and when not awarded the
background reason,

* Termination of a DPS,

* Financing and Paying Parties,

* Review requests statistics,

* References to the received tenders for the lot covered by this
result,

* Framework Agreement Values associated to the lot (estimated
and maximal),

* Reference(s) to the contract(s) settled as a result of the
made decision,

* Energy Efficiency information when the Energy Efficiency Directive applies,

* Statistical results for some strategic procurement projectsfootnote:[At the LotResult level, 
CVD information may be provided so long the Lot has been awarded and the CVD directive 
applies to the Lot. It is then possible to report the CVD Contract Type (BT-735-LotResult), 
and for each of them, the Vehicle Category (BT-723-LotResult), and for each of these the 
number of Vehicles, Zero Emission Vehicles, Clean Vehicles (OPT-155-LotResult, OPT-156-LotResult)],

* Reference to the lot the result applies to.

[[lotResultStructureFigure]]

image::image015.jpg[image,327,494]


For each lot, there may not exist more than one LotResult within the
same notice except for cases like Contracts involving a Framework Agreement 
or a Dynamic Purchasing System and for which the notice is used for reporting purposes.

the number of tenders received from tenderers registered in countries

must be counted, regardless of whether they are admissible or
inadmissible. For tenders submitted by a group of tenderers (e.g. a
consortium), the tender must be counted in the relevant category (e.g.
SME) if the majority of the work is expected to be done by tenderers
which fall within this category (e.g. they are SMEs). (Code from the
