=== Referring to sections of a notice

When creating a change or modifying a Contract, an author has to identify the notice sections
involved. The section references will be extracted from the notice itself (i.e. the technical
identifiers will exist and be known).
The following table lists the usable identifiers available to refer to
the different sections. Section for which the text is in grey italic
can't be updated with a Change notice and there is therefore no code
associated (_NA_).

[[pointlessDueToDesignSection]]
== Pointless Business Terms due to design

Structural differences between the eForms Regulation Annex and UBL 
(e.g. normalized vs denormalized data) make some Business Terms not 
necessary and not possible to represent.
Additionally, some indicators based rules make those indicators and 
their associated Business Terms useless.
