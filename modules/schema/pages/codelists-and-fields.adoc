===	Exclusion grounds codelist

This codelist covers all possible codes for exclusion grounds.

The list is the one defined for the ESPD.

The codes are reported in the table below; the ones in bold are highly recommended. 
From the EU legislation perspective, these are mandatory, however derogations are 
possible (cf. <<codelists-and-fields-R1>> â€“ art. 57). To identify precisely which value to use, 
the contracting authority shall also consider local legislation.
