= eForms Preview environment

== Scope and purpose

The Publications Office (OP) is developing a range of applications for the collection, validation, processing, visualisation and dissemination of eForms notices. These applications are collectively known as "TED Apps for eForms" and are scheduled to go into production use on November 14, 2022. 

To allow early access to these applications before they are deployed in production, we have prepared an additional "preview" environment for eSenders and stakeholders, where we progressively deploy early versions of the TED Apps for eForms as they become available.

The application features, URLs as well as the data present in the "preview" environment, are subject to unannounced changes until the go-live deadline is reached in November 2022. 

CAUTION: For accessing the web applications in the "preview" environment (eNotices2 and the TED Developer Portal), you need an EU-Login acceptance environment account which you can get at https://ecas.acceptance.ec.europa.eu/cas. 

== TED Apps for eForms

The TED applications for eForms are: 

eNotices2:: eNotices2 is the reception system for eForms. Notices can be submitted and managed through the web front-end or via the TED API. eNotices2 replaces the current eNotices and eSentool applications. eNotices2 calls the Central Validation Service to validate submitted notices before sending them to TED Monitor for processing and eventual publication.

TED Central Validation Service:: 
The Central Validation Service (a.k.a. TED CVS) provides an API for validating eForms notices. It is called by eNotices2 to check the validity of a submitted notice, but it can also be called by eSender applications to validate a notice at any time.

TED Viewer:: 
Also known as "TED Viewer 2022" this notice visualisation service provides an API that allows applications to render an eForms notice in the HTML or PDF format.

TED Developer Portal::
The TED Developer Portal is envisioned to be a central hub for TED developer services. At this point in time, the portal allows eSenders to sign-up and obtain/manage their API key which is required for calling TED APIs.


TED Monitor::
Also known as "TED Monitor 2022", this application is the internal production system used by OP to prepare the publication in the Supplement of the Official Journal (hosted in the TED website) of the public procurement notices submitted every day. It also allows OP to check the lawfulness of certain notices and to mask unpublished fields. 
+
NOTE: TED Monitor is not accessible by eSenders in the "preview" environment.

TED Website:: 
TED is the public dissemination website for European procurement notices. It is the digital (and only) form of the Supplement to the Official Journal of the EU (OJ S). The current TED website, which is being adapted to handle eForms notices, is scheduled to be replaced by a totally new, built-from-scratch version (a.k.a. TED 2.0), in Spring of 2023.

NOTE: The TED website is not available in the "preview" environment

CAUTION: The URLs and parameters may change in subsequent releases.

WARNING: Please be aware that the interface and the notice forms are very much a work in progress in this release. 

==== Currently available
[horizontal] 
Application version:: NRP-A2
SDK version:: 0.4.2 


==== Known issues 
At this point, the application is incomplete, many use cases are not fully implemented and others have dependencies in other applications which are only mocked-up. Similarly, the notice forms are not final as they are missing conditional rules, and significant tweaking or corrections of the sections is still to be expected. 

All the labels in the user interface (UI), notices and fields are subject to change – what you see are only placeholders and the UI is only fully available in English. The translated labels will not be available for several more months.  

The application is not integrated with any other TED applications, which means there are some limitations to what it can do. 

    * Notices do not go through validation when they are submitted, therefore do not expect any other validation than the live validation rules that you will find within the form-filling tool. 
    ** Mandatory fields are shown by red asterisks. 
    ** Live validation fields will have a red highlight until the right pattern is entered.
    ** Some of the rules for mandatory fields and patterns aren’t fully correct in this version.
    ** Clicking on the validation button produces an error.

    * Submitted notices aren’t published. They will have to go through another workflow in TED Monitor before they can be published, which takes place every working day around 15:00 CET, before you can create a Change notice or continue a procedure. 
    * The notices can partially be previewed in either HTML or PDF.

In this version, the application is expected to allow users to create the 40 eForms notice types plus the 5 other notice types which include the 2 transport regulation notices, the European economic interest grouping and European company/cooperative registration forms, and the call for expression of interest. The fields which are available, along with their behaviour, are consistent with SDK 0.4. In the codelist fields, prefilling of values is supported. 

The application also allows users to act upon notices and procedures, archiving, renaming and transferring them to other users or other procedures as well as import/ export notices in XML. There is also a search feature which allows users to sort through long lists of procedures. The main nature of the LOT can now be correctly defined.

Users can create workgroups between themselves and test the definitions of roles and permissions within these workgroups. They can also work and submit notices worked upon collectively.

Users can also define personalised settings for the legal basis and notice types that they want to use, as well as default languages in the notice, and tailoring of some fields is available (please note that adding a "default" currency will not allow you to create a Change notice):

* Optional fields can be set to mandatory or hidden.
* Confidential fields can be set to be always confidential or non-confidential. 

The first iteration of the address book has been implemented, which allows users to create a database of addresses of known organisations which regularly take part in the procurement process and import them in their notices. 

eNotices2 uses the codelists from the SDK, which have not been tailored. This means that certain codelists have too many entries, such as countries or languages that no longer exist. 

The eNotices2 API URLs and parameters will change in later releases. The Swagger UI provides basic documentation of the four functions. 


==== Planned updates 
[horizontal]
Indicative planning:: August 2022
Applcation version:: NRP+1
SDK version used:: 0.6.2

This version of the application is focused on improvements to the UI experience and the correction of bugs.

There are many improvements in the form filling tool including the possibility to filter optional fields and a notable improvement to the usability of CPV and NUTS codelists.

The address book usage has been improved and the notion of main buyer allows users to set up their own “contracting body” to be always present, except within the workgroups.

Users can see an improved mock-up of the CVS.

In the notice sections a search feature has been added and pagination for up to 2000 lots is supported.
