== Notice subtypes

The https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32019R1780[eForms Regulation] defines, in table 1 of its annex, a list of types of procurement notices.

In order to avoid confusion with the more general notion of "notice type" (contract notice, contract award, PIN, etc.), we are designating each specific item as "notice subtype". So a notice subtype corresponds to a specific column in table 2 of the annex to the eForms regulation.

The https://github.com/OP-TED/eForms-SDK[eForms SDK] provides this information in the `notice-types` folder, as a structured JSON file named `notice-types.json`.

This file contains some metadata, followed by the list of notice subtypes, and the indication of the corresponding XML schema.

<1> Version of the UBL standard used.
<2> Version of the eForms SDK the file belongs to.
<3> Version number and date of the data used to create this file.
<4> Document type of the notice subtype, used to determine the XML namespace and root element of the XML notice.
<5> Legal basis for the notice subtype.
<6> The standard form for the notice subtype.
<7> The notice type for the notice subtype. Values are from the "notice type" codelist.
<8> Description of the notice subtype, from the eForms regulation.
<9> Identifier of the notice subtype.
<10> Identifier of the document type
<11> XML namespace for the document type
<12> Root XML element for the document type. 

From the information visible in the example above, we can see that the notice subtype 1 has the document type `PIN`, so the root element in the XML is `PriorInformationNotice`.
The definition of each root element is in the corresponding file present in the folder `schemas/maindoc` in the eForms SDK.


== Definition of a notice subtype

For each notice subtype, we define the content and structure of the form that notice authors will fill in. We provide this definition as a set of JSON files, with one file per notice subtype.
Those files are available in the https://github.com/OP-TED/eForms-SDK[eForms SDK], in the folder `+/notice-types+`, and are named as follows:
`+<id>_<formType>_<type>_<legalBasis>.json+`

We are using these files to provide the definition of all notices to our form-filling application (eNotices2).

These files reference the fields present in the form via their identifier. The information for every field is centralised in xref:fields:index.adoc#field-repository[the field repository].

=== Usage of underscore in key names

Data which could be derived from other existing data is indicated using keys starting with an underscore character.
This means that we provide this data for convenience but that it could be obtained through other provided data.

Example: `"_label" : "field|name|BT-02-notice"`, could be found in the translations by looking up `BT-02-notice`, it is provided so that you just have to use `_label` and not worry about how to build the proper identifier.

=== Overall structure

The definition of a notice subtype has 2 parts:

* metadata, containing fixed fields that are automatically set by the system
* content, defining the actual form that notice authors will fill in.

==== Metadata Structure

The metadata part is a flat list of fields.

    "description" : "Procedure Identifier",
    "_label" : "field|name|BT-04-notice",
    "readOnly" : true
  },
  ...
]
----

==== Content Structure

A content is either a group or a field. A group has nested content, a field cannot have nested content.
The `contentType` indicates if is a `group` or `field`.
The form content is an array of root level content objects, composed of nested groups and fields, as shown below.
The fields must reference a valid field of the field repository by `+fieldId+`.
The `+groupId+` can be freely defined, as long as its value is unique in the file.
The `+nodeId+` can reference an `xmlStructure` node, it may be present for some groups.
The `description` property for groups and fields is to complement the identifier for readability, it should not be shown to application users or used in a technical way.
The `_label` property is a translation identifier referencing a translated label, this is to be used in applications.

All direct elements of the *content* array are treated as sections which can optionally define the groups they contain as subsection by specifying `+"displayType": "SECTION"+`.

        "_label" : "field|name|OPT-300-Procedure-Buyer"
      }, {
        "id" : "BT-11-Procedure-Buyer",
        "contentType" : "field",
        "displayType" : "COMBOBOX",
        "description" : "Buyer Legal Type",

        "description" : "Buyer Profile URL",
        "_label" : "field|name|BT-508-Procedure-Buyer"
    }, ...]
  }, ...]
}, ...]

The following table lists all available properties for groups and fields.

[cols="3,1,1,5,10"]
|===
|Property |Group |Field |Values |Description

|_repeatable   |x |x |false (default), true |The group/field is repeatable and the user can create one or multiple instances.
|readOnly     |- |x |false (default), true |The field is visible, but not editable.
|hidden       |- |x |false (default), true |The field is not visible and thus not editable.
|displayType  |- |x |GROUP, SECTION, CHECKBOX, COMBOBOX, RADIO, TEXTBOX, TEXTAREA |The field is rendered as the specified input element, SECTION may be applied to groups.
The default values depend on the field's datatype and not all values are allowed for every datatype: a date cannot be displayed as radio buttons, but a codelist can.
|_idScheme |x |- |any string e.g. "LOT" |The prefix used by the form filling tool to create an instance list with the corresponding name that keeps track of all existing instances of that group.
|idSchemes    |- |x |any string e.g. "LOT" |The prefix used by the form filling tool to select a value from the corresponding `idScheme`.
Instead of a free-text input field, a select box with all the existing instance IDs is displayed.
|instanceIdField  |- |x |any string e.g. "LOT" | This property flags a field as the one containing the instance ID of the specified prefix. Those fields must be contained in a notice to create a valid XML notice, but can be hidden to the user.
|valueSource  |- |x |any string e.g. "BT-137-LotsGroup" | This property indicates that the source of the value for this field should come from the specified field
|===

== JSON and XML structure constraints

The purpose of the notice subtype definition is to abstract the form displayed to a notice author from the eForms XML notice generated by the system.
While it can be slightly customized, it cannot have an arbitrary structure, it must be aligned with the eForms XML schema to some extent.

For instance, the *number of repeatable groups* (in a path from the content root to a field) in the JSON structure *must match* the *number of repeatable parent elements* (in a path from the document root to the field element/attribute) in the eForms XML schema.

There is no constraint on non-repeatable groups.
An arbitrary number of intermediate, non-repeatable groups can be created to organize the notice fields in a more convenient way. Moreover, the fields of the same level of the repeatable structure (ignoring non-repeatable groups) can be specified in an arbitrary order.

It is even possible to split a repeatable XML element group into multiple repeatable JSON groups.
In such case, the XML element group must contain an (instance) identifier field (e.g. BT-137-Lot - Purpose Lot Identifier), which is also contained in every JSON group part.
