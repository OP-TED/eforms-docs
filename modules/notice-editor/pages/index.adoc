NOTE: The documentation of the Notice Editor Sample Application is **not yet ready** for publication. We are working on it and we will update this page as soon as we have something we can share.

To demonstrate how you can use the eForms SDK in a *metadata driven application* that allow the user to fill-in and submit eForms notices, we have created this sample application. The application is https://github.com/OP-TED/eforms-notice-editor[available on Github]. You are encouraged to use it for inspiration or as a basis for further development. You are also welcome to contribute with pull requests any improvements that you want to share with us and other eSenders.

CAUTION: The notice Editor is not a production ready application. It is intended to demonstrate the use of concepts and resources available in the eForms SDK. You can use it as an inspiration or a starting point for your own apps.
